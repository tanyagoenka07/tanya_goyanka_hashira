=======================================
Processing Test Case 1:
=======================================
Number of roots (n): 4
Minimum roots required (k): 3

--- Converted Roots (Base 10) ---
Root 1: Base 10, Value "4" -> Base 10: 4
Root 2: Base 2, Value "111" -> Base 10: 7
Root 3: Base 10, Value "12" -> Base 10: 12
Root 6: Base 4, Value "213" -> Base 10: 39

--- Summary ---
All roots in Base 10: [4, 7, 12, 39]

We have 4 roots, which is sufficient (>= 3) to determine a polynomial of degree 2.
